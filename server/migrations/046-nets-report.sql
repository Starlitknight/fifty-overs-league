-- 046-nets-report.sql — THE COACH'S MORNING NOTE GETS ITS OWN SHELF.
--
-- Training v2 has the umpire write a short report after every settle: who
-- stepped up, who is carrying load. It briefly rode inside clubs.training -
-- but that blob is the MANAGER'S plan, verbatim, and test 016 rightly
-- refuses any hand but his in it (the banked plan must equal what he set).
-- So the report gets its own column, and world_my_status carries it down
-- beside the plan rather than inside it.
